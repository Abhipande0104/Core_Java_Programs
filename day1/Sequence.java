/*
 * Sequential Programming Construct
 * 
 * Linear execution of code.
 * Focused towards achieving problem solution.
 * Modular with library function.
 * Developer decides functionality invocation
 * 
 * 					task1
 * 
 * 					task2
 * 
 * 					task3
 * 
 * Building more responsive applications
 * 
 * User should feel he is in he control.
 * Application behaviour is based on user's action
 * Every user action is given some response
 * Applications are easy to use
 * 
 * Why graphical user interface programming
 * --command line
 * 		text input
 * 		cumbersome to use
 * --gui
 * 		interesting
 * 		more user friendly
 * 		easy to learn 
 * 		more intuitive
 * 
 * Event driven programming
 * 
 * Application architecture based on event occurence, detection and handling
 * 
 * Application modularised in 3 parts
 * --event generators
 * --event link
 * --event handlers
 * 
 * each module is responsible for specific task
 * event object used to link the generators with handlers
 * 
 * GUI Frameworks
 * 
 * Java frameworks
 * --awt/swing
 * --javaFX
 * --Flex
 * 
 * non-java framework
 * --.net informs
 * --visual basic
 * --oracle forms
 * 
 * what is swing
 * 
 * -used to create rich gui applications for enhanced user experience
 * -exhaustive api for generating graphical user interface
 * -part of java foundation class(JFC).
 * -based on earlier implementation of abstract window toolkit(awt)
 * -avilable through javax.swing package.
 * 
 * why swing
 * -removes platform dependency prevelent in awt.
 * 		no need for platform specific peer classes
 * -lightweigh in comparision to awt
 * -eases programming efforts
 * 		undo-redo support built-in for text components
 * 		2d graphics rendering simpler
 * 		pluggable(customizable) look and feel.
 * -swing components implement model view controller design pattern for 
 * flexible ui rendering.
