/*
 * POLYMORPHISM
 * 
 * Ability of different objects to respond to the same message in different ways 
 * is called polymorphism.
 * 
 * polymorphism support resolves the method call to suitable implementation
 * 
 *  Why polymorphism
 *  Polymorphism allows to design and implement system that are more eaisily 
 *  extensible and maintainable
 *  
 *  Early and late binding
 *  --the binding of a member function call with an object is called
 *  compile time/ static time/ early binding
 *  --static polymorphism is achieved by method overloading in java.
 *  
 *  --the binding of function call to an object at run time is called as 
 *  run time/ dynamic binding/ late binding
 *  --dyanamic polymorphism is achieved by method overriding in an inheritance.
 *  
 *  Method Overriding
 *  - Polymorphism is achieved using overriding functions using inheritance
 *  - It gives ability to define a behaviour thats specific to the sub class
 *   type based on its requirements
 *  - Methods with same name, same signature and same return type in superclass
 *   and subclass
 *  - The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object 
 *  that is used to invoke a method
 *  
 *  parent object----parent method
 *  child object-----child method
 *
