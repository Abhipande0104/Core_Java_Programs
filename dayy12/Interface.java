/*
 * INTERFACE
 * 
 * -to achieve role based inheritance (as multiple inheritance is not allowed
 *  we can have more than 2 interface inherited)
 * -to create loosely coupled applications.
 * 
 * an intrface (university) defines a contract between a provider(college)
 *  and a consumer(student)
 * enables common design across those classes not in hierarchy
 * 
 * defines a standard set of properties, methods and events
 * any class implementing an interface has to provide the functionality
 * 
 *  Features of interface
 *  --interface is essentially a collection of constants and abstract methods 
 *  -- the interface approach is sometimes known as "programming by contract"
 *  --data members in an interface are always public, static and final
 *  --
